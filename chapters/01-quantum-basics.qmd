# Quantum Mechanics Basics

Welcome to the quantum world. In this chapter, we'll build the mathematical foundation you need to understand quantum computing—from first principles, with rigorous proofs and no hand-waving.

## The Quantum State

In classical physics, a bit is either 0 or 1. In quantum mechanics, a **qubit** (quantum bit) can exist in a **superposition** of both states simultaneously.

### Mathematical Representation

A quantum state is represented as a **vector** in a complex vector space called a **Hilbert space**. For a single qubit, this is a 2-dimensional space.

The computational basis states are:

$$
|0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Notation:** We use **Dirac notation** (or "bra-ket" notation):
- $|0\rangle$ is pronounced "ket zero" - represents a column vector
- $\langle 0|$ is pronounced "bra zero" - represents a row vector (conjugate transpose)

### General Qubit State

The most general state of a qubit is a **superposition**:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
$$

where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ (complex numbers) and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

**Key insight:** The state exists in *both* $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ simultaneously until measured.

## The Superposition Principle

One of the foundational principles of quantum mechanics:

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}
## Superposition Principle

If $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$ are valid quantum states, then any linear combination:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|\psi_1\rangle + \beta|\psi_2\rangle
$$

is also a valid quantum state (provided it's normalized: $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$).
:::

### Example: The Hadamard State

One of the most important quantum states is:

$$
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

This is an **equal superposition** of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

Similarly, we can define:

$$
|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Together, $\{|+\rangle, |-\rangle\}$ form an alternative **basis** for the qubit's Hilbert space (the **X-basis** or **Hadamard basis**).

## Measurement and the Born Rule

When we measure a quantum state, something dramatic happens: the superposition **collapses** to one of the basis states.

### The Born Rule

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="simple"}
## Born Rule (Measurement Postulate)

Given a quantum state $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$, when measured in the computational (Z) basis:

- Probability of measuring $|0\rangle$: $P(0) = |\alpha|^2$
- Probability of measuring $|1\rangle$: $P(1) = |\beta|^2$

After measurement, the state **collapses** to the measured outcome.
:::

### Example: Measuring $|+\rangle$

Consider the state $|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$.

When measured in the Z-basis:
- $P(0) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(1) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$

**Interpretation:** We get 0 or 1 with equal probability (50/50), and the state becomes either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ after measurement.

## Normalization Condition

The probabilities must sum to 1. This gives us the **normalization condition**:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

Let's prove this is required.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false appearance="minimal"}
## Proof: Normalization Ensures Valid Probabilities

**Claim:** For a quantum state to yield valid probabilities, it must satisfy $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

**Proof:**

By the axioms of probability, the sum of all possible outcomes must equal 1:

$$
P(0) + P(1) = 1
$$

By the Born rule:

$$
P(0) = |\alpha|^2, \quad P(1) = |\beta|^2
$$

Therefore:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \quad \square
$$

This is called the **normalization condition**. Any valid quantum state must be normalized.
:::

### Inner Product and Normalization

We can express normalization using the **inner product** (or dot product) in Hilbert space:

$$
\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = 1
$$

where $\langle\psi| = (\alpha^* \quad \beta^*)$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\psi\rangle$.

**Calculation:**

$$
\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = (\alpha^* \quad \beta^*) \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix} = \alpha^*\alpha + \beta^*\beta = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

## Measurement in Different Bases

The Born rule applies to **any** orthonormal basis, not just the computational basis.

### Z-Basis vs X-Basis

**Z-basis (computational basis):**
$$
\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}
$$

**X-basis (Hadamard basis):**
$$
\{|+\rangle, |-\rangle\} = \left\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)\right\}
$$

### Example: Measuring $|0\rangle$ in X-Basis

To measure $|0\rangle$ in the X-basis, we first **express it in that basis**:

$$
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|-\rangle
$$

**Verification:**
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) = \frac{1}{2}(2|0\rangle) = |0\rangle \quad \checkmark
$$

Now applying Born rule:
- $P(+) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(-) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$

**Key insight:** The state $|0\rangle$ is a **superposition** when viewed in the X-basis! This is called **basis-dependent measurement** or **contextuality**.

## Global Phase and Physical Equivalence

Consider two states:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
$$

$$
|\psi'\rangle = e^{i\theta}(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle) = e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle
$$

where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $e^{i\theta}$ is a **global phase factor**.

**Claim:** These states are **physically indistinguishable**.

**Why?** Measurement probabilities are unchanged:

$$
P(0) = |e^{i\theta}\alpha|^2 = |e^{i\theta}|^2|\alpha|^2 = |\alpha|^2
$$

since $|e^{i\theta}| = 1$ for any real $\theta$.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}
## Global Phase Irrelevance

States that differ only by a global phase factor are **physically equivalent**:

$$
|\psi\rangle \equiv e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle
$$

However, **relative phases** (phases between different components) *are* observable and physically meaningful.
:::

### Example: Relative Phase Matters

These two states are **different**:

$$
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
$$

$$
|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
$$

The relative phase between $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ components ($+1$ vs $-1$) is observable when measured in the X-basis!

## Quantum State Space: The Bloch Sphere

For a single qubit, we can visualize the state space geometrically.

Any single-qubit state can be written as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle
$$

where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$.

This parameterization maps quantum states to points on a **unit sphere** in 3D space called the **Bloch sphere**.

**Key points on the Bloch sphere:**
- **North pole** ($\theta=0$): $|0\rangle$
- **South pole** ($\theta=\pi$): $|1\rangle$
- **Equator** ($\theta=\pi/2$):
  - $\phi=0$: $|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$
  - $\phi=\pi$: $|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$
  - $\phi=\pi/2$: $|+i\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + i|1\rangle)$
  - $\phi=3\pi/2$: $|-i\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - i|1\rangle)$

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Why the Bloch Sphere Matters

The Bloch sphere gives us geometric intuition about quantum states. Antipodal points (opposite ends of a diameter) represent **orthogonal states** - states that are maximally distinguishable by measurement.
:::

## Pure States vs Mixed States

So far we've discussed **pure states** - states with definite (though possibly superposed) quantum information.

In reality, quantum systems often exist in **mixed states** due to:
- Incomplete knowledge about the system
- Interaction with the environment (decoherence)
- Entanglement with other systems

Mixed states are described by **density matrices** (we'll cover this in later chapters).
