# Welcome to The QRL Book {.unnumbered}

Learn quantum computing and Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) using the **Quantum Relational Language** (QRL) - a relations-first approach to quantum programming.

## What You'll Learn

This book teaches quantum computing from first principles, building up to advanced topics in MBQC and photonic quantum computing:

- **Part I: Quantum Foundations** - Understand qubits, entanglement, and n-qubit systems
- **Part II: MBQC Theory** - Learn cluster states, graph states, and measurement patterns
- **Part III: QRL Programming** - Write quantum programs with hands-on tutorials
- **Part IV: Advanced Topics** - Explore tensor networks, categorical quantum mechanics, and fault-tolerant QC

## Why QRL?

Unlike gate-based quantum languages (Qiskit, Cirq, Q#), QRL treats **quantum entanglement as a first-class primitive**, making it natural to express:

- Cluster states for MBQC
- Measurement patterns for photonic quantum computers
- Relations-first quantum algorithms
- Graph state compilation

## Prerequisites

- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, complex numbers, basic probability
- **Programming**: Python basics (QRL is implemented in Python)
- **Physics**: Helpful but not required - we explain quantum mechanics from scratch

## How to Use This Book

### For Learners
Start with Part I to build quantum foundations, then move through hands-on tutorials in Part III.

### For Researchers
Jump to Part II for MBQC theory or Part IV for advanced topics like tensor networks.

### For Programmers
Install QRL and dive into Part III tutorials - learn by doing!

## Installation

```bash
pip install quantum-relational-language
```

See [Appendix: Installation](appendix/installation.qmd) for detailed setup instructions.

## Code Examples

All code in this book is:
- **Executable** - Run examples directly in your Python environment
- **Open source** - Available at [github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language](https://github.com/dcoldeira/quantum-relational-language)
- **Tested** - Every example is verified to work with the latest QRL release

## About the Author

**David Coldeira** is a scientific software engineer with a BSc in Physics, specializing in quantum programming languages and MBQC. He developed QRL to explore relations-first approaches to quantum computing.
